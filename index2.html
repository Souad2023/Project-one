                <h2>FIFA Club World Cup <strong> 2025 </strong>: Dates, tournament format and qualifiers</h2>
                <p>The following criteria also apply:
    
                    In the event that a club wins two or more editions of the Continental Confederation's premier club competition during the period <strong> 2021-2024 </strong>, the club's ranking calculated according to the sporting criteria will be used to grant access.
                    A maximum of two clubs per country will be applied to the access list with an exception in cases where more than two clubs from the same country win the Confederation's premier club competition during the four-year period.
                    The tournament will see a group stage consisting of eight groups of four teams each, with the top two teams advancing to the round of sixteen.
                    The FIFA Council also unanimously approved the concept of an annual club competition from  <strong> 2024 </strong>, in response to the fact that the  <b>FIFA Club World Cup </b> will be held for the last time in its current format in  <strong> 2023 </strong>
                    
                    This annual tournament will bring together the winners of the premier club competition in each federation, and will conclude with a final held at a neutral venue between the winner of the UEFA Champions League and the winner of the intercontinental 
                    playoffs between clubs representing the other continental federations.</p>

                <h2>What ranking system did FIFA use to determine the teams participating in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup?</h2>
                <p> <b> <i> The performance of teams at the continental level in the four years leading up to the FIFA Club World Cup is evaluated based on the following formula: </i></b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            3 points for each victory</li>
                        <li> 1 point for each draw</li>
                        <Li>3 points for each qualification to an advanced stage</Li>
                    </ul>
                    <b><i> For Europe, the ranking criteria is slightly different and is linked to the teams' results in the UEFA Champions League as follows: </i></b>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 points per victory</li>
                        <li> 2 points per victory</li>
                        <li>4 points for advancing past the group stage</li>
                        <li>5 points for advancing to the round of 16</li>
                        <li> A point for qualifying from any round thereafter</li>
                    </ul>
